Motivational study experience: Dynamically targets the 80% “desirable difficulty” zone for maximum engagement and learning flow.

Pomodoro + cognitive indicators: Built-in session timer, fatigue detection, and visual memory confidence help you maintain focus, avoid burnout, and track your progress.

Rich media flashcards: Supports text, images, and flexible deck management.

Beautiful, cross-platform interface: Modern React frontend with a Python (Flask) backend—runs as a electron app on Mac or in your browser.
